### Introduction
This project focuses on applying various machine learning techniques to predict outcomes using a structured dataset. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of preparing data, training models, and evaluating their performance. It utilizes multiple regression models and ensemble techniques to enhance predictive accuracy.

### How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with categorical features being encoded using OneHotEncoder. Numerical features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure consistency across different scales.

2. Feature Engineering: New features are created by combining existing ones to capture potential interactions between variables. For example, interaction terms like GroundFloor_LivingArea and TotalArea_Rooms are generated to enrich the feature set.

3. Outlier Handling: Outliers in numerical columns are addressed using Z-score, ensuring that extreme values do not skew the model's predictions.

4. Dimensionality Reduction: Low-variance features are removed to reduce dimensionality, simplify the model, and improve performance.

5. Modeling: Several models are defined, including Ridge and Lasso regressions, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, using the best hyperparameters obtained from a parameter tuning process.

6. Ensemble Learning: A VotingRegressor is employed to combine predictions from multiple models, leveraging the strengths of each model to improve overall performance.

7. Evaluation: The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score, both on training and testing data.
